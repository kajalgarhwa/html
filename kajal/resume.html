	<p align="right">The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across Sakchi (present-day a business district), on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.[17]

In 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began.[17] The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912. It was a momentous day in the history of industrial India.[18]
